Hi!
This is a small project I made to test a basic trading strategy using moving averages.

⚙️ What it does:
Gets 5 years of stock data using yfinance

Calculates:

SMA (Simple Moving Average)

EMA (Exponential Moving Average)

Buys when EMA crosses above SMA

Sells when EMA crosses below SMA

Tracks performance vs. buy-and-hold

Plots trades and returns

🧪 Why I built it:
I’m learning algorithmic trading and Python — this helped me understand indicators, signals, and backtesting logic.

📚 Tools used:
yfinance, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn

Hope this helps someone!
